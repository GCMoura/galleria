## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SCSS
- Javascript
- React JS

### What I learn

  I put into practice my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 to develop this application, using semantic tags and media query to style the mobile version. In addition, I put my previous knowledge of Javascript into practice. Improved skills in React, such as using useState.
On the backend I improved my skills in Express and Axios.
Also, using the [Rijskmusem API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/) I learned more about integrating with an external API.
